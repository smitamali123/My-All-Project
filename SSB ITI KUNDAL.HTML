ITI stands for Industrial Training Institute and is a government training agency that provides
industry-related education to high school pupils. It was founded in 1950. At the same time, 
several trades are still available after the eighth grade. 
These institutes are specifically designed to provide technical information to 
students who have recently completed the 10th grade and are interested in getting some 
technical knowledge rather than pursuing further education. The Directorate-General
for Employment and Training (DGET), the Ministry of Skills Development and Entrepreneurship,
and the Government of the Union formed ITI to give training in several trades. 
There are various Industrial Training Institute, both governmental and private,
around India that provide vocational training to students. The ITIs provide instruction
in the following trades-
